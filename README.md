# Bunghole Document Aligner

Bunghole is a document aligner designed to assist professional translators in the production of translation memories from existing translated material.

Translation memories in TMX or TAB delimited format generated by Bunghole can be used in most modern CAT (Computer Aided Translation) programs.

TAB delimited files created by Bunghole can be opened in Microsoft Excel or Apple Numbers without special configurations.
